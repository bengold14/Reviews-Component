# Reviews-Component

Reviews-Component is a project which copied the functionality and styling of the TripAdvisor Reviews Component (example: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34467-d268715-Reviews-Cove_Inn_on_Naples_Bay-Naples_Florida.html) from scratch.  It is a full stack web application created using React, Express and Sqlite3.  Both the component and the proxy server that links to it are deployed on AWS EC2, as shown below:
